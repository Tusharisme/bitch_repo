The Indian High Court Judgement dataset contains judgements from the Indian High Courts, downloaded from [ecourts website](https://judgments.ecourts.gov.in/). It contains judgments of 25 high courts, along with raw metadata (as .json) and structured metadata (as .parquet).

- 25 high courts
- ~16M judgments
- ~1TB of data

The data is stored in an AWS S3 bucket:

`s3://indian-high-court-judgments`

Data layout:

- `data/pdf/year=2020/court=madras/bench=madurai/*.pdf`
- `metadata/parquet/year=2020/court=madras/bench=madurai/metadata.parquet`

Use DuckDB to answer these:

1️⃣ Which high court disposed the most cases between 2019 and 2022?  
2️⃣ What is the regression slope of the delay between `date_of_registration` and `decision_date` per year for `court='madras'`?  
3️⃣ Plot the average delay (days) per year as a scatterplot with a regression line. Return the image as a base64 data URI (under 100,000 characters).

Output should be JSON:

```json
{
  "Most disposing court 2019-2022": "...",
  "Regression slope": "...",
  "Delay plot": "data:image/png;base64,..."
}
