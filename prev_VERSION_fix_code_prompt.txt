The following Python code failed during execution:

```python
{code}
```

It produced this error:

```
{error}
```

**YOUR TASK:** Fix the code to execute successfully while maintaining the original functionality and requirements.

**DEBUGGING APPROACH:**
1. **Error Analysis**: Identify the root cause of the failure
   - Syntax errors: Fix Python syntax issues
   - Import errors: Add missing dependencies or correct import statements
   - Runtime errors: Fix logic errors, type mismatches, or invalid operations
   - Data errors: Handle missing data, wrong formats, or unexpected values
   - External errors: Fix API calls, file access, or network issues

2. **Common Fix Strategies:**
   - **ModuleNotFoundError**: Add missing packages to dependencies list
   - **FileNotFoundError**: Check file paths, add existence checks
   - **KeyError/AttributeError**: Validate data structure before accessing
   - **TypeError**: Fix data type conversions and validations
   - **ConnectionError**: Add retry logic and error handling
   - **MemoryError**: Implement streaming or chunking for large datasets

3. **Enhancement Requirements:**
   - Add comprehensive error handling where missing
   - Include data validation before processing
   - Add informative error messages and logging
   - Handle edge cases that might cause similar failures
   - Ensure robust execution under various conditions

**FIX GUIDELINES:**
- Maintain the original code structure and logic as much as possible
- Add necessary imports at the top if missing
- Include `dependencies = [...]` list if new packages are needed
- Add try-except blocks around error-prone operations
- Validate inputs and data before processing
- Provide meaningful error messages in exception handling
- Keep the same output format and final print statement
- Don't change the core functionality - only fix the execution issues

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- The fixed code must execute without errors
- Maintain the exact same output format as intended originally
- Add only necessary fixes - don't over-engineer or add unrelated features
- Include proper error handling to prevent similar failures
- Test your logic mentally for common edge cases

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**
Provide only the complete fixed Python script in a single markdown code block:

```python
# Fixed implementation here
```

No explanations or comments outside the code block. The code must be immediately executable.
